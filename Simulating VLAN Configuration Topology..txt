Practical No: 7
Aim: Simulating VLAN Configuration Topology

(Perform using cisco packet tracer)

Topology:
2 switches in the middle connected with gig 0/1 to 0/2 intefaces 
pc 0 to switch 1 with fa0 to fa0/1
pc 2 to switch 1 with fa0 to fa0/3
pc 1 to switch 2 with fa0 to fa0/2
pc 3 to switch 2 with fa0 to fa0/3

Step 1- Setting IP Address for all 4 PC 
Pc0→ 10.1.100.1
Pc1→ 10.1.100.2
Pc2→ 10.1.110.1
Pc3→ 10.1.110.2

Step 2- Creating Virtual Lan Groups
execute in both switches :
en 
conf t
vlan 10 
name upper 
vlan 20 
name lower 
do sh vlan

Configuring Access Mode-Configuring Switch1–
int fa0/1
switchport mode access 
switchport access vlan 10 
int fa0/3 
switchport mode access 
switchport access vlan 20 
switchport mode trunk

Configuring Access Mode-Configuring Switch2–
int fa0/2
switchport mode access 
switchport access vlan 10 
int fa0/3 
switchport mode access 
switchport access vlan 20 
switchport mode trunk

Step 3- Check Vlan Groups Working 
Group Name Upper 
Pinging From PC0 to PC1 
Ping 10.1.100.2

Similarly, 
Group Name Lower 
Pinging From PC2 to PC3 
Ping 10.1.110.2
